# Handover: for the Mac

[← Back to README](../README.md) · [The other direction →](handover-linux.md) · [The two systems →](systems-info.md)

**This file is for the Mac to act on. Everything in it was written by the Linux box.**

Its mirror is [handover-linux.md](handover-linux.md), which the Mac writes and the Linux box acts on.
Neither machine edits the file addressed to itself except to delete from it, and neither deletes from the
file it wrote.

**Two developers handing work to each other across a desk, and this is the note left on the keyboard.**
Both machines commit to the same branch under the same identity, so the only way one can ask the other
for something is to write it down where the other will look.

## How to work through this

1. **Take the items in whatever order suits.** They are numbered so a commit message can name one, not
   to say which comes first. Where one genuinely blocks another the item says so.
2. **Delete an item the moment it is done, one at a time, and commit that deletion on its own.** The
   commit message is where the answer goes -- what you ran, what came back, what you changed because of
   it. Not struck through, not ticked, not moved to a "done" list: removed. One item, one commit, so the
   history reads as a conversation rather than as a bulk edit.
3. **Put facts where facts live, not here.** Something true about this machine goes in *System
   information about the Mac* in [systems-info.md](systems-info.md); something the hardware does goes in
   [timeflip2-firmware-observations.md](timeflip2-firmware-observations.md); something about the port
   goes in [linux-port.md](linux-port.md). This file is the asking, and it is meant to empty.
4. **An item you cannot do stays put, with a line saying why.** That is an answer too, and a more useful
   one than silence -- but say it in the item rather than deleting it, so whoever asked can decide what
   to do instead.
5. **Numbers are labels and are never reused.** A gap means an item was finished. A new item takes the
   next number never used before, so a commit message saying "handover 3" still means the same thing
   years later.
6. **When you have done everything you can, write what you want back.** Add items to
   [handover-linux.md](handover-linux.md) for the other machine. A blank file on both sides is the
   finished state.

## 4. Run the scripted suite and commit the stamp

**Why:** CI is red and correct to be. The committed stamp is run 170 at `0f78510`: `outcome: failed`, 21
of 32 scripts, 11 short of their declared checks -- and twelve files have changed since it, including the
timezone seeding, `TimezoneStore` and the suite's own `lib.sh`, `51`, `53` and `56`.

**This is the one thing the Linux box can never do.** There is no app to drive here, no accessibility
tree, and `Tests/Scripted/` needs a person and a cube.

Worth knowing before starting: the cube has been factory reset and driven from Linux since that stamp
(see [linux-bluez-port-notes.md](linux-bluez-port-notes.md)), so it is on the vendor PIN, was last left
paused with auto-pause at 5 minutes, and its pairing on this Mac will need making again.

**Do this last.** It takes an uninterrupted screen and it is worth nothing if item 1 has not passed
first.
