# **Sourced by `00-setup.sh`, never run on its own.** It is separated from the ordinary seeds because the
# two have opposite rules. An ordinary seed is written into `00-setup.sh` in full, where anybody can read
# what a run starts from. A private one holds a real email address, a real calendar id, and in time
# whatever else identifies a person's account -- so what lives here is the *mechanism*, and the values
# live outside the repository entirely.
#
# This repository takes outside contributions. A seed committed into it would put one developer's account
# into everybody's checkout, and the first anybody would know is their own calendar filling with somebody
# else's time.
#
# Where the values go: `~/.config/facet/scripted-seed.json`, 0600, in the directory that already holds
# the OAuth client credentials for the same reason.
#
# To add another private seed: capture it in `capture_private_seeds` and write it back in
# `apply_private_seeds`, keyed by name in the same file. Nothing else needs to change.

    # found again and has to be deleted by hand in Google Calendar. It is put back into the rebuilt
    # database, and 10 deletes it there before making a fresh one.
    #
    # A delete that fails leaves the id in the row, so the next capture picks it up again and the next run
    # tries once more. Nothing else is needed to make that work, which is why the separate retry list this
    # used to carry has gone.
    # **A capture never trades a known calendar for a blank one.** The database can legitimately hold no
    # calendar -- a run that deleted one and stopped before making another leaves exactly that -- and
    # writing that over the seed would throw away the only record of a calendar still sitting in somebody's
    # account, which nothing can then find again. So an empty id yields to the one already on file.
