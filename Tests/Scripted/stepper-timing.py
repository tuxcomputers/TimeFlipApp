"""Reads what a held stepper arrow actually did, out of the app's own debug log.

    Tests/Scripted/stepper-timing.py <since_debug_log_id> "<category name>"

Prints one `key=value` per line, for a shell check to read:

    values=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15,20,25
    steps=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5
    singles_count=9   singles_avg_ms=101
    fives_count=3     fives_avg_ms=304
    ratio=3.0

**The timing is the point, and it is only readable because each tick writes a row.** `SteppedNumberField`
reports every value the hold passes through, not just the one it ends on, and `debug_log.logged_at` keeps
milliseconds -- so the gap between consecutive rows is the tick interval the app actually used. The rule
being checked (`StepperHoldRules`) says 0.1s while stepping by 1 and 0.3s once stepping by 5, so the
by-five ticks should come out about three times slower. A control that changed step size without slowing
down would step by 5 at the speed of 1 and run away from whoever is holding it, which is the fault worth
catching and is invisible to a check that only reads the final number.

`singles_avg_ms` excludes the first gap, which carries the 0.4s wait before a hold starts repeating and
is not a tick interval at all.
