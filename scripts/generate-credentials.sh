# Puts the Google OAuth client into the build, so a distributed copy can sign in.
#
# **This is the only way credentials reach somebody who is not the developer.** `GoogleCredentials.resolve`
# tries an environment variable and `~/.config/facet/google-client.json` first, and both of those are files
# on one machine. What this writes is the third source, the one that travels with the binary.
#
# It copies the download to `Sources/FacetApp/Resources/google-client.json`, which is gitignored, so neither
# value is ever committed. Not because either is confidential -- under a Desktop OAuth client the "secret"
# is not a secret, and PKCE is what actually protects the exchange (see `GoogleOAuthRules.pkce`) -- but so a
# release build and a developer build can point at different projects without editing code, and so the
# repository stays publishable without a second thought.
#
# **A resource rather than a generated Swift file, and that is not a stylistic choice.** The Swift-file
# version was built first: a gitignored source file, with `Package.swift` checking whether it existed and
# defining `HAS_BUNDLED_CREDENTIALS` when it did. It fails silently, which is the one thing it must not do.
# SwiftPM caches the manifest, so the existence check does not re-run when this script creates the file --
# measured on 2026-08-30: generator runs, `swift build` succeeds, define absent, credentials quietly not in
# the binary and nothing anywhere saying so. `Package.swift` already `.process`es the whole `Resources`
# directory, and that is a directory scan at build time rather than a manifest-time decision, so a file
# appearing in it is picked up with no cache to defeat.
#
# **File present means credentials are bundled, file absent means they are not**, and the app finds that out
# at runtime rather than at compile time -- so a fresh clone with no credentials builds exactly as it always
# did. This script therefore **removes** the resource when it has nothing to put there, rather than leaving
# a stale one behind from a project somebody has stopped using.
#
# Source, in the same order the app itself tries:
#   1. $FACET_GOOGLE_CLIENT_JSON
#   2. ~/.config/facet/google-client.json
#
# Both are the Google console's own download, unedited, so there is nothing to transcribe.
#
#   scripts/generate-credentials.sh            # write it, or remove it if there is no source
#   scripts/generate-credentials.sh --check    # say what would happen, write nothing
#
# Exits 0 whether or not credentials were found: a fork with no Google project builds a working app that
# simply cannot sign in, and the App tab says so in words (`GoogleAccountRules.noCredentialsNote`).
