"""Finding and driving elements of a running GTK app, by name, over AT-SPI.

Shared by `at-press.py`, `at-dump.py`, `at-set.py`, `at-alert.py`, `at-hold.py` and `at-key.py`,
which are the Linux counterparts of the `ax-*.py` scripts and take the same arguments. What differs
between the two families is not the arguments but what the attributes *mean*, and it is worth saying
once here rather than in six files:

**On Linux the accessible name is the identifier and the description is the value.** That is this
app's own split and it is forced rather than chosen: a `GtkButton` reports its label as its
accessible name, so every control that wants an identifier has to overwrite it, and the value it
would otherwise show has to go somewhere -- `SettingsWidgets.identify(_:_:saying:)` puts it in the
description. On macOS `AXIdentifier`, `AXTitle` and `AXValue` are three separate attributes and
nothing has to share.

**So a check script must not call either family directly.** It says `platform_press`, and
`Tests/Scripted/platform.sh` decides what that means -- which is the same reason that file exists at
all. A check written against `--desc` would be asking for the label on one platform and the value on
the other.

`Tests/Methods.md` Method 20 is where the technique was measured.

    **`whole_tree=False` does not descend into a notebook page that is not selected**, and that is
    what makes a search by name unambiguous rather than merely usually right. GTK keeps every page
    of a notebook built and in the tree whether or not it is on show, and this window has the same
    identifier on more than one of them on purpose: `create-category`, `category-name-field` and
    `save-category` are the Categories tab's create control and the Faces tab's, which are the same
    control doing the same job. A plain walk finds whichever was built first.

    **Showing-state is not enough to tell them apart**, which is worth recording because it is the
    obvious fix and it fails quietly. Measured 2026-09-20 with the Faces tab selected: its
    `create-category` reads showing, the Categories tab's does not, and so far so good -- but
    `category-name-field` reads *not* showing on both, because that field is revealed by pressing
    Create and is hidden until then. So a rule of "prefer the showing one" silently falls back to
    the wrong tab for exactly the elements a check is about to type into.
